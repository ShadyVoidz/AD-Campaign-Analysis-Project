# Advertising Campaign Performance Analysis
---
## Project Description

As a part of my **Machine Learning Fundamentals Skill Path** from Codecademy, I have created this project to put together and improve on the skills I have learned through analyzing data from the "Advertising Campaign Performance Dataset" I have collected from Kaggle.

Currently I am using the programming language Python and will be using various libraries to further expand on my analysis (E.g. Pandas, matplotlib.py, Seaborn, and NumPy)

## Project Goals ü•Ö

My main aim in this project is to put together all of the skills I have learnt from the Machine Learning Fundamentals Skill path and hopefully build upon/improve those skills. This project will allow me to help solidify my knowledge in areas such as "Exploratory Data Analysis".


#### Questions I plan to answer:

  1. What platform produces the best results for a campaign?
  2. What content type produces the best results for a campaign?
  3. What content type are viewers more likely to click onto?
  4.
